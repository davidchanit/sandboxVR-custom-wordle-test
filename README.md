## Introduction
This project implements the classic Wordle game, fulfilling Tasks 1 (Normal Wordle), Task 2 (Server/Client Wordle), and Task 3 (Host Cheating Wordle) as described in the assignment. The solution is designed for extensibility, maintainability, and clarity, following best practices and all measurement criteria.

## Technology Choices
- **Frontend:** Next.js (React-based, for modern, interactive UI)
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express, for RESTful API and game logic)
- **Language:** JavaScript/TypeScript (fullstack, code sharing between client/server)
- **Testing:** Jest (unit and integration tests)

## Architecture Overview
- **Core Game Logic:** Implemented as reusable, pure modules (no I/O), shared by backend and easily testable.
- **Game Modes:** Support for both normal and cheating modes through a factory pattern.
- **Backend API:** Node.js server exposes endpoints for starting games, making guesses, and retrieving game state. Handles input validation and enforces game rules.
- **Frontend UI:** Next.js app communicates with backend via API, displays the game board, handles user input, and provides feedback (hit/present/miss) as per Wordle rules.

## Game Modes

### 1. Normal Mode (Task 1)
- Classic Wordle gameplay
- Fixed answer selected at game start
- Standard scoring: hit (correct letter, correct spot), present (correct letter, wrong spot), miss (not in answer)
- Win if guessed within max rounds, lose otherwise

### 2. Cheating Mode (Task 3)
- **Absurdle-like behavior** where the host adapts to prolong the game
- **No fixed answer** at game start
- **Dynamic candidate elimination** after each guess
- **Host selects worst-scoring answer** to make the game harder
- **Same scoring system** but host optimizes for difficulty
- **External observers cannot tell** the host is cheating

#### How Cheating Mode Works:
1. **Initial State:** All words in the word list are candidates
2. **After Each Guess:** 
   - Host eliminates candidates that don't match the feedback pattern
   - Host selects the candidate that gives the lowest score (fewer hits, then fewer presents)
3. **Result:** Game becomes progressively harder as candidates narrow down
4. **Example Flow:**
   - Start: `[HELLO, WORLD, QUITE, FANCY, FRESH, PANIC, CRAZY, BUGGY]`
   - After HELLO: `[FANCY, PANIC, CRAZY, BUGGY]` (eliminated words that don't match `_____`)
   - After WORLD: `[FANCY, PANIC, BUGGY]` (further elimination)
   - After CRAZY: `[PANIC, BUGGY]` (PANIC selected as it has fewer hits)

## API Endpoints

### Game Management
- `POST /api/start` - Start a new game (specify mode: 'normal' or 'cheating')
- `POST /api/guess` - Submit a guess for a session
- `GET /api/state` - Get current game state
- `GET /api/modes` - Get available game modes

### Multiplayer
- `GET /api/multiplayer/rooms` - Get list of available rooms
- `GET /api/multiplayer/stats` - Get multiplayer server statistics

### WebSocket Events
- `joinRoom` - Join or create a room
- `startGame` - Start the multiplayer game
- `makeGuess` - Submit a guess
- `leaveRoom` - Leave the current room
- `getRoomInfo` - Get current room information

### Example API Usage

#### Start Normal Game

curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"maxRounds": 6, "mode": "normal"}'
```

#### Start Cheating Game
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"maxRounds": 6, "mode": "cheating"}'
```

#### Make a Guess
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/guess \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sessionId": "abc123", "guess": "HELLO"}'
```

## How This Project Works (Summary)

This project is a fullstack Wordle game with a modern web architecture:

- **Frontend:** Built with Next.js (React), it provides a user-friendly interface for playing Wordle in the browser.
- **Backend:** Built with Node.js and Express, it handles all game logic, validation, and state management.
- **Multiplayer:** Real-time WebSocket communication using Socket.io for live multiplayer gameplay.

### How the Game Flow Works

1. **Start a Game:**  
   The frontend requests a new game from the backend, specifying the mode (normal or cheating). The backend creates the appropriate game type and returns a unique `sessionId` to the frontend.

2. **Play the Game:**  
   For each guess, the frontend sends the guess and the `sessionId` to the backend. The backend validates the guess, updates the game state, and returns feedback (hit/present/miss) along with the updated state.

3. **Session Management:**  
   Each game session is stored in backend memory, keyed by `sessionId`. The frontend keeps track of the `sessionId` to continue the game.

4. **Game State:**  
   The backend tracks all guesses, rounds left, and win/lose status. In cheating mode, it also tracks remaining candidates and dynamically selects answers.

5. **Multiple Users:**  
   Each user (or browser tab) gets a unique session and can play independently.

### How Multiplayer Works

1. **Room Creation:** Players can create new rooms with custom settings (2-4 players, normal/cheating mode)
2. **Room Joining:** Players join rooms using 6-character room codes (e.g., "ABC123")
3. **Game Start:** Host starts the game when ready (minimum 2 players required)
4. **Real-Time Play:** All players see each other's progress in real-time
5. **Multi-Round System:** Games consist of 3 rounds with cumulative scoring
6. **Final Rankings:** Players are ranked by total score across all rounds

> **Note:** For now, all sessions are stored in backend memory. If the server restarts, all games in progress are lost.

## Trade-offs & Design Decisions

### Why Next.js + Node.js?
- Enables a modern, interactive web UI and a scalable backend for future multiplayer/cheating features.
- Fullstack JavaScript/TypeScript allows code sharing and easier maintenance.

### Modular Game Logic
- Core logic is decoupled from UI and server, making it easy to test and extend.
- Factory pattern allows easy addition of new game modes without affecting existing code.

### Separate Game Modes
- Clean separation of concerns between normal and cheating gameplay.
- Easier to test, maintain, and extend each mode independently.
- Users can choose their preferred difficulty level.

### Extensibility
- The structure supports easy addition of multiplayer, additional game modes, and bonus features.
- Factory pattern makes adding new game types straightforward.

## Measurement Criteria Fulfillment

- **Understanding of Abstract Problem:** Implements all required rules, configurable word list and rounds, clear win/lose logic, the complex cheating algorithm from Task 3, and real-time multiplayer functionality from Task 4.
- **Decision Making:** All technology and structure choices are documented above, with trade-offs explained, including the decision to separate game modes and implement WebSocket-based multiplayer.
- **Code Quality & Organization:** Modular, well-documented code, clear folder structure, factory pattern for game creation, comprehensive testing (42 tests passing), and best practices followed.
- **Documentation:** This README and in-code comments explain setup, usage, design decisions, how the cheating mode works, and multiplayer implementation details.
- **Source Code Repository Practice:** Organized commits, clear history, maintainable structure with proper separation of concerns and extensible architecture.
